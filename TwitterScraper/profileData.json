        "comment": "Please no one buy from this fraud company. I paid a hefty premium and i was told right out from that point that whatever I want to do is \"not covered\". Right now I have a problem with my feet. Can't walk properly. Need a small surgery to be done. I went to hospital. Got everything recommend and in written by doctor. And yet after this they are just delaying and delaying the process of cashless. And for that I had to cancel my appointment. I am still alive. Imagine what will you do if something worse happen to your near and dear one and you needed to rely on health insurance to bring them back alive and well. I am having nightmare thinking about it. If they sent my small surgery \"for internal verification\" Imagine what will they do if you raise a claim for larger sum? Worst company. Do not buy from them if you value your money and the lives of you and your near ones.",

But here it’s completely opposite. I lost and wasted my money. Your agent was fake and lack of knowledge. He gave us false and fake promises. I’m so disappointed. Poor service big time.",
